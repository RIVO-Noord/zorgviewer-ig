The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version 1.0 is not allowed to be used at this point (this element is [BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; allowed for this version = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/4.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ImplementationGuide.dependsOn.packageId from FHIR version 4.0 is not allowed to be used at this point (this element is [BackboneElement, ImplementationGuide.dependency]; allowed for this version = e:ImplementationGuide.dependsOn; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# On purpose; for documentation only
Bundle is labeled as an abstract type, but no concrete descendants were found (check definitions - this is usually an error unless concrete definitions are in some other package)
